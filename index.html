          While it is important to have naturally occurring sugars in your diet,
          many foods contain harmful added sugars that contain no nutritional
          value. According to a study conducted by the University of Florida,
          the brain releases heroin-like chemicals called endogenous opioids
          when an individual indulges on sweet, salty or fatty foods.

              Eating a healthy dose of protein, such as red meat, organic
              chicken and fish, in addition to healthy fats including avocado

              One of the reasons why so many people end up eating unhealthy
              snacks is simply because they don’t consider taking the time to
              source healthier alternatives.

              Sepel is a strong proponent of magnesium, personally taking
              approximately 500mg a night to help moderate her blood glucose
              levels. Magnesium can also be naturally found
